[HTMLElements](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) wrapped like hot burritos!

# Features
  * A simple way to work with HTMLElements within JavaScript.
  * An HTMLElement is only ever wrapped once (instances not garbage collected are reused).

# Work in progress

It's still a work in progress... So I'll write more here later!
